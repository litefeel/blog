## CLI (Command Line Interface)核心命令

- `/` = root directory
- `~` = home directory
- `pwd` = print working directory (current directory)
- `clear` = clear screen
- `ls` = list stuff
	- `-a` = see all (hidden)
	- `-l` = details
- `cd` = change directory
- `mkdir` = make directory
- `touch` = creates an empty file
- `cp` = copy
    - `cp <file> <directory>` = copy a file to a directory
    - `cp -r <directory> <newDirectory>` = copy all documents from directory to new Directory
    - `-r` = recursive
- `rm` = remove
    - `-r` = remove entire directories (no undo)
- `mv` = move
    - `move <file> <directory>` = move file to directory
    - `move <fileName> <newName>` = rename file
- `echo` = print arguments you give/variables
- `date` = print current date 


## GitHub基本操作指令

- **工作流程** 
    1. 在工作区编辑文件make edits in workspace
    2. 更新文件目录/添加文件
    3. 向本地代码库commit提交修改
    4. 向远程代码库push提交更新修改
- `git add .` = add all new files to be tracked
- `git add -u` = updates tracking for files that are renamed or deleted
- `git add -A` = both of the above
    - Note: `add` is performed before committing
- `git commit -m "message"` = commit the changes you want to be saved to the local copy
- `git checkout -b branchname` = create new branch
- `git branch` = tells you what branch you are on
- `git checkout master` = move back to the master branch
- `git pull` = merge you changes into other branch/repo (pull request, sent to owner of the repo)
- `git push` = commit local changes to remote (GitHub)


## Markdown基本语法

- `##` = 二级标题
- `###` = 三级标题
- `*` = 无序列表


## R Packages

- Primary location for R packages --> CRAN
- `available.packages()` = all packages available
- `head(rownames(a),3)` = returns first three names of a
- `install.packages("nameOfPackage")` = install single package
- `install.packages(c("nameOfPackage", "nameOfPackage", "nameOfPackage")` = install multiple package
- Bioconductor Packages:
    -  `source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")`
    -  `biocLite()` = install bioconductor packages
- `library(packagename)` = load package
- `search()` = see all functions in package after loading



## 数据科学的研究问题类型

- 问题按难度分别为: ***Descriptive*** --> ***Exploratory*** --> ***Inferential*** --> ***Predictive*** --> ***Causal*** --> ***Mechanistic***
- **Descriptive analysis** = describe set of data, interpret what you see (census, Google Ngram)
- **Exploratory analysis** = discovering connections (correlation does not = causation)
- **Inferential analysis** = use data conclusions from smaller population for the broader group
- **Predictive analysis** = use data on one object to predict values for another (if X predicts Y, does not = X cause Y)
- **Causal analysis** = how does changing one variable affect another, using randomized studies, Strong assumptions, golden standard for statistical analysis
- **Mechanistic analysis** = understand exact changes in variables in other variables, modeled by empirical equations (engineering/physics



## 数据
- **Data** = values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items (usually population)
- **Variables** = measurement/characteristic of an item (qualitative vs quantitative)
- **Data** = not always structured, usually raw file, different formats
- Most important thing is question, then it is data
- **Big data** = now possible to collect data cheap, but not necessarily all useful (need the right data)

## 实验设计
- Formulate you question in advance 
- **Statistical inference** = select subset, run experiment, calculate descriptive statistics, use inferential statistics to determine if results can be applied broadly
- ***[Inference]*** **Variability** = lower variability + clearer differences = decision
- ***[Inference]*** **Confounding** = underlying variable might be causing the correlation (sometimes called Spurious correlation)
    - dealing with confounding: fix variables, stratify (all options), randomize
- ***[Prediction]*** collection observations for different variable values, build predictive functions
    -  similar problems of probability/sampling and confounding variables
- ***[Prediction]*** Difficult to understand where observation is from from different distributions. (size of effects important)
- ***[Prediction]*** Positive/negative statuses: True positive, false positive, false negative, true negative
    - **Sensitivity** = Pr(positive test | disease)
    - **Specificity** = Pr(negative test | no disease)
    - **Positive Predictive Value** = Pr(disease | positive test)
    - **Negative Predictive Value** = Pr(no disease | negative test)
    - **Accuracy** = Pr(correct outcome)
- **Data dredging** = use data to fit hypothesis 
- **Good experiments** = have replication, measure variability, generalize problem, transparent
- Prediction is not inference, and be ware of data dredging
